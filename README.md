# Welcome!

Thank you for taking the time to look at my portfolio website's repository!

It's a simple project, but I hope it can demonstrate a few things about how I prefer to work and what is valuable to me as a developer.

Here's a few things to call out:

- **Meaningful, standardized commit messages** - I like to be able to browse a project's history and quickly find when and why things were added or changed.
- **Easy development setup** - The very first thing added to this project was the configuration for VS Code Dev Containers. Development setup is as simple as pressing "open in dev container".
- **CI/CD** - Another early addition was CI/CD via GitHub Actions. For a simple project like this, I added two things: PR checks that ensure each change going into `main` follows formatting rules and didn't break the build, and deployment automation that packages the app into a docker container and publishes it to GitHub's container registry.
- **Simple, logical project layout** - This is certainly easier to do on such a small project, but there is still effort put into reusing components and layouts, and organizinging logically into folders.
